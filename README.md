## Building the Application

This application can be built for both macOS and Windows as standalone executables that don't require Python to be installed.

### üçé Building for macOS

**Requirements:**
- macOS 10.15 or later
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Run on the target Mac system (Intel or Apple Silicon)

**Enhanced Build Process:**

1. **Download/Clone the project files to your Mac**

2. **Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/OrcaSlicer-Config-Manager
   ```

3. **Run the enhanced build script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x build_mac.sh
   ./build_mac.sh
   ```

**Interactive Build Features:**
- **Smart Dependency Checking**: Verifies Python version, pip, and required modules before building
- **Installation Strategy Selection**: Choose from multiple installation methods if you encounter permission issues:
  - Standard install (recommended)
  - User directory install (fixes externally-managed-environment errors)
  - Virtual environment (safest approach)
  - System override (with confirmation)
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Post-build verification ensures your .app bundle is complete and functional

**What Gets Installed:**
- PyInstaller for building executables
- Google Drive API libraries for cloud sync (optional)
- OAuth2 authentication libraries

**Result:**
- Complete `.app` bundle: `dist/OrcaSlicer Configuration Manager.app`

- **Full System Validation**: Checks Windows environment, Python version, pip, and all required modules
- **Smart Dependency Installation**: Installs PyInstaller and cloud storage libraries with fallback options
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows detailed build progress with error handling
- **Executable Validation**: Post-build verification ensures the .exe is properly created and functional
- **File Size Analysis**: Warns if executable size seems incorrect

**What Gets Installed:**
- PyInstaller for building executables
- Google Drive API libraries for cloud synchronization
- OAuth2 authentication support

**Result:**
- Single executable file: `dist\OrcaSlicer-Config-Manager.exe`
- Full cloud storage integration included

## Important Notes

### üîß Build Requirements
- **macOS executables** can only be built on macOS systems
- **Windows executables** can only be built on Windows systems
- PyInstaller creates platform-specific executables

### üì¶ Distribution
- **macOS**: Distribute the entire `.app` bundle folder
- **Windows**: Distribute the single `.exe` file
- Both versions are completely self-contained
- Cloud features work without additional setup

### üîí Security & Privacy
- Google Drive uses OAuth2 - no passwords stored
- iCloud uses local filesystem access
- All credentials stored locally and encrypted
- No data transmitted except to chosen cloud services

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility
- **macOS**: 10.15+ (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: Windows 10+
- **File Size**: ~13-15MB with cloud features
- **Dependencies**: None required on target machines

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**macOS Issues:**
- "Application not supported": Build on actual Mac system
- "Externally-managed-environment": Use build script's interactive installer selection
- Permission errors: Try user directory installation option

**Windows Issues:**
- Windows Defender warnings: Normal for PyInstaller builds, add exception
- PATH issues: Build script includes Python PATH verification
- Missing modules: Comprehensive dependency checking prevents build failures

**Cloud Storage Issues:**
- Google Drive: Requires internet connection for initial setup
- iCloud: Ensure iCloud Drive is enabled in System Preferences
- Authentication: Stored locally, re-authenticate if issues persist
